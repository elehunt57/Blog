# A short introduction: computer science by Sabrata Dasgupta

## Chapter one - the 'stuff' of computing

Chapter one provides an introduction to the field of computer science, briefly outlines some of the key areas of thought, and introduces the idea that computer science is based on automatic symbol processing.

Dasgupta begins by offering Alan Perlis’, Allen Newell’s and Herbert Simon’s definition of computer science as 'the study of computers and their associated phenomena'. One of the fundamental aspects of computer science is information and 'the computer is a means by which information is automatically retrieved from the environment, stored, processed, or transformed, and released back into the environment’. 

Dasgupta goes on to explain that the computer is an automaton, a term coined in the 17th century that referred to 'any artefact which, largely driven by its own source of motive power, performed certain repetitive patterns of movement and actions without external influences'. An early example of an automaton is a cuckoo clock. Computers are more modern automata as they were designed to simulate and imitate certain kinds of human thought processes.

In short, computers are automata that process information, meaning computer science is the study of information processing. However, within the field of computer science there are conflicting opinions around the terms information, data, and knowledge and the role they play within the computer.  

**Information**

The Oxford dictionary definition of information is ‘facts provided or learned about something or someone’. It is meaningful and it tells us something about the world. In contrast, information theory, largely created by American electrical engineer Claude Shannon in 1948, defines information as devoid of meaning, 'a commodity transmitted across communication channels'.

The unit of information in information theory is called a bit (short for binary digit) and has two values 1 or 0. This then translates to bytes where each byte in comprised of 8 bits which represent the numbers 0 to 256 ranging from 00000000 (which represents the number 0) to 111111111 (which represents the number 256).
